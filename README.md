# Chat Program
Files that are included for this program:
-- Makefile: This is used to compile the .cc file and create a executable file.
-- chat.cc: This is the code to the chat program

This is a program created to chat between two different computers, kind of an imitation of a chat program that establishes sockets and more. 

Make sure to do all of this in the same directory as the files listed. To run this program type 'make' which should produce a file 'chat'. To run the server type './chat' which should produce an output that implies that it is waiting for the client. Now run './chat -p [PORT NUMBER] -s [IP ADDRESS]' where you replace [IP ADDRESS] with your desired IP address and replace the [PORT NUMBER] with 3493. If it gives you an error just terminate the program and wait a few seconds.
